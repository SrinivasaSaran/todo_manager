# README

This is a guided Project as it is my first project on web development using Ruby on Rails. 
Here we can add and delete a todo. Also we can update the status of the todo as pending or completed.
It sorts the todos as Overdue, Due Today and Due Later depending on the deadline of a particular Todo.
